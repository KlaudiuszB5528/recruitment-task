# recruitment-task
My solution to the recruitment task. I used vite over create react app because it's faster.
For form handling and validation I chose Formik with Yup. It's simple to use and does its job.
You can check 
## [Live Demo](https://klaudiuszb5528.github.io/recruitment-task/ "recruitment-task")
Or run it locally.
Please note that the swapi.dev is currently down so I changed it to the working alternative swapi.py4e.com. If it's up at the moment that You're checking the page You can uncomment lines 54-56 to use swapi.dev and comment 57-59 lines at context/people.tsx
